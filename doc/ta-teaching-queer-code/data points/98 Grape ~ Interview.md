[Interviewer]: Of all the submissions, is there one that sticks out to you and could represent your whole course completion? 
[Participant]: I feel like, judging by vibe, I'd take the third one with the ugly pink sponge as a background. 
[Interviewer]: Excuse me, it's one of my favorite backgrounds [laughs]. All these backgrounds are publically sourced that encourages using them all over the internet, so I felt like it fit the project very well!
[Participant]: That's awesome. ==I think the sponge one is just perfect. And it shows very well how I approached the study.==
