[Interviewer]: Correct. Would you be confident in discussing these topics with other laypeople? 
[Participant]: I think so. I am not much of a debater. 
[Interviewer]: Not really debating. Just an exchange of information on the topic. 
[Participant]: Yeah! I was already successful in taking two of my friends out of a terrible argument about a white representative of a black rights organization, and the so-called cancel culture. Luckily, we agreed that despite his degree in African Studies, people don't want to be represented by him. 
[Interviewer]: I'm glad you found an agreement with them. 
[Participant]: Me too!
