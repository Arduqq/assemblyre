Based on the faces of their workers, the system was trained to accept people that fit that standard, yet the trained data was devoid of people of color, which strongly preferred accepting white people. It's one of the reasons why, even though we have no idea what happens behind the curtains of such systems, we are affected by them. I also would like to commend you on the fact that you used so much pseudocode in your submissions. Can you tell me a little about that? What were your inspirations?
