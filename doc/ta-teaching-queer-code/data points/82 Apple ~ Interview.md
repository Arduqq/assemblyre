[Interviewer]: Would you like to find more practical resources on the topic? Working on a programming language?
[Participant]: I ==had some very simple Delphi programming== in school back then. In university, I thought to myself, okay, you're a researcher, you better get into programming, so I learned some Python basics. I didn't really need them yet, though.
[Interviewer]: Any ideas of what it may be? Something professional? Something private?
[Participant]: I believe it would be more for a practical application in terms of data analysis. ==Do you know this memory game where you have squares leading up to a big square==, and you have to memorize the pattern sequence? Each round, a new part of the pattern lights up or makes a sound, and you have to reproduce it every time. I tried to program something like this, but discontinued it. I might attempt the project again, though. Just to not forget it. I remember it from my childhood from some random games.
