[Interviewer]: Yeah, you're describing digital literacy here. The intuition to use such programs. The moment we don't have this ability, we get vulnerable to attacks by people that are really skilled in it. Can you recall any other sources from the study? Anything you found interesting? You really liked generative artistry, apparently. Maybe you played some of the games, as well, or watched some videos!
[Participant]: Yeah, I can actually recall many of the resources because I checked them all out. ==One in particular was this game where you play the role of a king, and then people approached you with questions, and you had to answer while keeping them happy== [laughs] and I failed miserably! 
[laughter]
[Participant]: That, I still remember. Then there were some video sequences, but I honestly forgot about most of them. I did watch them, and oh yeah, there were like interviews that went for over an hour. I zapped in but oh no ... ==I remember this one video on black people and how the system discriminates based on skin color because it wouldn't fit the white norm==.
