[Interviewer]: I genuinely loved all your entries. You can see all of them here alongside your reasoning. I assume, you took great inspiration from the world around you to work on them. One of them stuck to me, it was the one based on the exhibition that you visited. Have you attended it? 
[Participant]: I have!
[Interviewer]: How did you like it?
[Participant]: It was some time ago, ==but it was definitely very surprising as well. I didn't read on it much. Okay hygiene, it must be about how can I prevent infections, and stuff like that. It was a lot more broad as it was a medical museum with many experiments to try out. And the screening of the private person, that glass person, maybe I can do something with that. It was about the whole world play with it. When I was there, there was another exhibition on race theory because the museum itself had an obvious problem with it back then. They talked about how race in general is not a real thing, but a social concept, and that putting humans into these kinds of groups is nonsensical.== 
[Interviewer]: I think it's very important to look at these topics through this interdisciplinary lens as you do. Do you remember any exhibitions on further digital topics? 
[Participant]: [pause] I don't believe it was the main topic. I really like visiting nature museums, those always have some more technical sections. But there wasn't really anything based on computer programming.
