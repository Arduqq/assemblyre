[Interviewer]: Great. Yeah, as I told you earlier, it's not really about what comes out in the end, but the fact that you actually created something is already an accomplishment. Since you did have computer science lectures, were you able to identify some of the principles you learned there in the course? 
[pause]
[Participant]: First, I had to work myself ==back into binary code==. I didn't have to, but I did. I did try to calculate some values and failed miserably. [laughs] But I recall that there was a chapter at the very beginning where it said something about height, open bracket, weight, open bracket, it all came back to me because we used this in the lessons when we ==worked with HTML==. It was a lot, but most of it was lost in the limbo.
