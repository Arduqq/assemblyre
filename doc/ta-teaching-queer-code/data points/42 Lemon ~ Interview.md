[Interviewer]: Was there anything else that you particularly liked and remember just now?

[Participant]: Sorting algorithms.

[Interviewer]: Sorting algorithms? Can you elaborate on what you found most interesting about them?

[Participant]: Yes I don't remember which one I found the coolest but I think it was MergeSort. I think it's awesome to know how you can make everything sort and it made me feel really good thinking about it. It just works. [laughter]

[Interviewer]: Did you research some of them? 

[Participant]: Yeah, it was part of the resources. That one video on algorithms!

[Interviewer]: Oh yeah, right! I am happy you enjoyed that.

[Participant]: Yes it was very concise and to the point and I quickly got some of it if not everything.
