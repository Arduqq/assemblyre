[Interviewer]: Yeah, finding out when there's a semicolon in a text. I find it remarkable how you developed your own style in these submissions. The course itself barely teaches you explicit syntax, and you made it up for yourself in your own language.  Where did this come from?
[Participant]: When I ==create variables, and I don't see their purpose, like the solutions on Stack Overflow, I don't see myself coding with them successfully==. That's why when I try to do something difficult, I do something like ArrayWithThisValue1. If there's an error, it's easier for me to find it again.
