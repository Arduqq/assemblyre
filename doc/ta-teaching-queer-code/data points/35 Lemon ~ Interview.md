[Interviewer]: What topics would you say were the most interesting ones to you?

[Participant]: I really enjoyed the discussions and the gallery sites. But at some point it was just Okay, I get it, and I didn't really know where to go from there, so I mostly created something that jumped to my mind while I looked at everything. I enjoyed the video on data because I never really understood what was happening there but now I feel like I got a good idea on the problems of what is done to your data online.
