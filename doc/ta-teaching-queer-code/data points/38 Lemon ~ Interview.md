[Interviewer]: So I would like to show you your submissions of the course. How does it make you feel looking at it.

[Participant]: [laughs] ==Some of those are just so crusty and silly==. Looking at them now really makes me love what I did here. Like this one [points to submission 2]. It's just a silly meme but I had so many thoughts on the topic and merging these two ideas just made sense in my head. [laughs]

[Interviewer]: Yeah I think this submissions really shows how you overcame your fear of circles [laughs].

[Participant]: Wait [pause] ==Oh yeah, this one was so frustrating because at first I thought I had to program this circle to move around but the interface just did not work for me, so I decided to just stick to this image.==
