[Interviewer]: How did you find it in general to try out the editor and what you can do there?

[Participant]: Well, the first two programs I didn't understand that it didn't run at all. I thought to myself, now I don't know if it works! And I was pretty sure that it didn't. [laughs] And then I kind of ==saw it more as a design element==. With the one, I just thought, that's perfect for a recipe. That's how I came up with the recipe too, because I thought "that's a really good list!". ==And then it also said cake [code OUT element in editor] and then I thought you could embellish that==. And then I thought, well, ==this doesn't have much to do with programming==, it's more like a little ideas page.
