[Interviewer]: When I designed the editor, I was actually really inspired by similar software, so I'm happy you noticed that. I  think it's a great entry point to work with digital interfaces. Now, if you ever went through a similar course again, is there something you wish it did better? Any additions you would like to see?
[Participant]: No, I actually found it perfect. It was very informative, yet diverse. The whole material was a lot of fun. It was really time-intensive, but you did warn me. And I also did take my time with it because I wanted and was able to. Back then [laughs] So I don't think that I would do anything differently.
