[Interviewer]: If the loops cause such problems. The thinking of these loops is often a big hurdle - you are not alone with this one, because you often have to oversee the broader context. It represents what happens in a time space that you can't really keep track of during programming. If there were programming languages that didn't have that. If it was more graphical, to maybe create a web page without any generation. Would you be up for doing something like that?

[Participant]: I can't imagine right now. So I thought maybe I should have used arrows to draw what goes where, but i didn't do that.

[Interviewer]: You did write a very good loop, I think.

[Participant]: Yes, but that's still short. Some of the information that's processed is really crass. 

[Interviewer]: Yes, if there's a second loop nested, it becomes critical again.

[laughter]

[Participant]: This one also turned out cool [points to submission 4]. Then I gave up on that thing and just [pause] added dot dot dot. 

[laughter]

[Participant]: So ==I thought, surely you can still loop this, but it occurred to me that I can feed each one in.== I didn't feel like doing that, so I said, you just imagine that I fed everything in one by one.
