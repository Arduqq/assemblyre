[Interviewer]: Did you have any particular problems with this open task? That you didn't have exactly one task, but that you had to try out something yourself?

[Participant]: Yes, I think, because all the courses, which I had already participated in, we had just a task to program this and that and this and that should come out at the end. And the first time I just tried it out and thought yes okay try it out. The second time I thought somehow that the tool would look different. So somehow what I had looked at before would come up and that I would have to work it in somehow. And then there was nothing and then I thought, did I do that wrong now? But once I understood that I can just kind of program one, not have to use a language somehow, then it was then it was quite cool because you [pause] Then you could think that through, like you would implement it, but it didn't matter now that the program probably wouldn't work. [laughter.]
