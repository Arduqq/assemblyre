[Interviewer]: I believe you had some programming experience. You already programmed something for university. Would you like to specify what you programmed in particular? 
[Participant]: Absolutely! ==Things I made that actually worked were in university, where I analyzed data.== For most of them, I didn't really know what I was doing, but it kinda worked out, like drawing polar plots in Python. This took me two days and was quite gruesome [laughs]. And yeah, small analysis algorithms like a k-means thing. Before the whole university stuff, I re-coded a calculator in C# to have a little text box that would translate glyphs into English letters. 
[Interviewer]: That's actually more than I assumed! They sound like really cool projects. Were you able to find some of the things you did back then in the study?
[Participant]: So in general, pseudocode, when you are dealing with stuff like analysis algorithms, where you don't know where to start, is genius. ==Most of the time, I have to annotate every line I write, so I know what it actually does==. If I  don't, then there won't be any problem-solving. I believe there was one thing I made [pause] with semicolons. Just some recursive thing.
