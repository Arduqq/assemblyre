[Interviewer]: While we're on your submissions, do you have any particular feelings when you look at it like that? [shows submissions]. 

[Participant]: So the first two I think are boring now because there's not that much happening except that one looks ==like a Pinterest page==. [First submission] I think that's when I was just hungry on the first one and had pears. And then from here [second submission] I had more fun. ==First of all, having an idea of what to program, I think that's one of the hardest things==. ==It reminds me of university, when you have to write a paper, and the most difficult thing is to find a topic. And it's the same with programming.== When I think about what I want to do with it, okay, but I would have to invest so much time in writing it, because I'm just not used to it. ==So if I now think of a text analysis that picks out words for me, I would be quicker to pick out the texts myself than to program that now==. Because I sit there for ages. That's why I always sat there, okay, you're going to do this now, but what do you actually want?
