[Interviewer]: [laughs] No worries that's fine. How did your strategy look like when you designed your submissions? You already said that you had initial problems every time, but I believe you sent them all in a very brief time frame.

[Participant]: Yeah, those submissions weren't the things I tried out over the weeks, but I made them all one train ride. 

[laughter]

[Interviewer]: For that, I find them very different and unique if you don't know that they were created on a train ride. They all tackle a different issue. I believe you also have many notes on all the topics? Did you use them for these submissions?

[Participant]: No, I didn't. ==At some point I said, screw it, I didn't even use any of the resources any more.==

[Interviewer]: You did. [points to submission 3] [pause] Well, as an inspiration. 

[Participant]: Well, yeah, the texts. ==And the examples that you sent me. When I saw them I knew, okay, those are more general situations.==
