[Participant]: I believe, ==I needed a bit of time to find an idea==. That's why I just looked at everything, for some, especially the ones that impressed me the most, I immediately had something. For the one with white background, I was like, I guess I'll just do something.

[Participant]: Oh, this one! ==Yeah, and we played a second time== through it to get the true ending.
[laughter] 
[Participant]: I believe, the actual coding part always came in between. ==I thought about what's going in and out, what's done to the input, is there anything saving and analyzing going on, and what is supposed to come out of there?== Those were the questions I thought about at first. Are there more than one output possibility? ==And then I gave it the last touch in the hopes that people who are not me will understand it.==
