[Interviewer]: You have participated in programming course. I'd like to ask you how you felt during that and how you enjoyed it.
[Participant]: I found it a bit ==surprising for a programming course==, I believe. What I felt? [pause] Well, obviously it ==pushed my creativity a little== [laughs] I didn't think it would require ==so much self-expression== for me. I thought it would be more structured. It was very open. The material impressed me in very different ways. 
[Interviewer]: Would you like to elaborate on that? What were your impressions on the different sources? 
[Participant]: Some resources ==were a bit tough for me==. I didn't check out all the material, like the books, or the 3-hour documentations. But there were other things that I found very interesting. Like the more creative things. Like the one artist who creates programmed art. Or the digital workshops where you are able to program something yourself.
