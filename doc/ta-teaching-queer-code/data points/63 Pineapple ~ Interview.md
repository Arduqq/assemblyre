[Interviewer]: If you ever attended such a course in the future, would you wish for a better introduction, or a better chapter on fundamentals? That's how it sounds to me.

[Participant]: Yes, exactly. ==Because from the very beginning, and I think that's good, you have this social discussion, and where you find it in daily life, I understood all that. But still, real coding kept being referenced, and that's where I maybe lost the connection.== 

[Interviewer]: Yeah, to catch that thought, how would you describe programming?

[Participant]: Oh god, I think in the beginning questionnaire we had to answer that as well. Now it's like, after?

[Interviewer]: Yeah!

[laughs]

[Interviewer]: Yeah, how would you describe it now?

[Participant]: I mostly thought about how programming could be, but I still don't know how it actually is. ==I don't really have the feeling that I actually programmed.==
