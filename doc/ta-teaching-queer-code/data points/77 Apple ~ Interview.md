[Interviewer]: I found very cool how you showed a lot of interest in using external sources. You actually had considerable self-study in that regard. What was your strategy for every submission? 
[Participant]: Yeah, at first I read the magazine, then I opened the links on your website. I looked at all of it, ==but skipped the parts that I didn't really have the energy or time for==. Some things I read through intensively. ==I also started taking some notes before I forgot some of the information==. Based on my notes, and the open questions that you posed, I thought about what one could at this point. What would inspire me now?
