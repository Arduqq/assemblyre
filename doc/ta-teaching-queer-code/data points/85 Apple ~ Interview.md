[Interviewer]: When were the moments you got the most ideas during your work on a chapter? 
[Participant]: Definitely while I was reading the resources. There I had most situations where my mind caught thought. ==But after further reflection, and looking at my notes, doing the dishes, I eventually found something==. It really depended on the topic.
[Interviewer]: Yeah, it was apparent that you continuously worked through the course. You didn't do everything all at once. Was there anything you found the most fun? 
[Participant]: [laughs] ==I liked the little minigames that you had scattered throughout the material. It was pretty relaxing in-between all the reading==. ==Also, the conceptualizing, and assembling everything was even more fun. While I worked on the task, created some elements,== I got even more ideas on what I could add. ==It created this flow where the submissions== eventually formed.
