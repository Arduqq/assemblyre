        <p>This website was created for a master's thesis study by Artur Solomonik from Bauhaus University Weimar. Hosted on <a href="https://www.glitch.com">Glitch</a>, all browser information, and server requests are handled by the site and not by the researcher. Any imported images are not stored anywhere and rely on third-party image hosting providers. All surveys are conducted over the <a href="https://so-sci.org">SoSci platform</a> and do not pass through any other third party.</p>
        <p>The research is inspired by the course introduced in <strong>Aesthetic Programming: A Handbook on Programming</strong> by Winnie Soon and Jesse Cox. The excerpts in the <em>Lyre Zine</em> are direct citations from the original texts and can be found on the official <a href="ttps://www.aesthetic-programming.com">Aesthetic Programming website</a>.</p>
        <p>The <em>Assemblyre programming environment</em> is created using the <a href="">VueJS frontend framework</a> for dynamic data processing with the help of the <a href="">InteractJS</a> for fundamental component transformations.</p>
        <p>All source code can be found publicly in the <a href="">Assemblyre GitHub repository</a>.</p>
        <p>Icons, cursors and illustrations were created by Artur Solomonik. All background images are openly accessible under <a href="">TextureTown</a>, a public repository for background textures of all kinds.</p>
        <p>Fonts used both in the tool and the zine, are powered by <a href="">Velvetyne</a>. In the following is the comprehensible list of original creators and collaborators of the respective fonts.</p>
