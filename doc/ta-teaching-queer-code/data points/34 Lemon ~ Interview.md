[Interviewer]: Oh yeah, I remember we had some initial problems. Why was that? Was it the open questions that I posed?

[Participant]: I don't think so. I found it very refreshing to have these big questions but it was overwhelming at first when you had all these problems and thoughts posed. I didn't really know where to even begin or whether I should even be able to answer them all or not. After we talked I actually understood that I can just do whatever I want, so that's what I did. Looking at the examples you sent me, I felt more free to submit whatever and suddenly I had a lot more fun with the course.
