[Interviewer]: You have been navigating a small website during the study. Can you recall it? 
[Participant]: Yeah. 
[Interviewer]: When you entered the site, what did you do, how did it feel, were there any frustrating moments? 
[Participant]: [laughs] Yeah, some. Foremost, I looked through every single site. Then, I chose what I wanted to work on, started creating, saved it, ==put it back in, and then it didn't work anymore. That's when I was a little frustrated==. [laughs] A big inspiration for me were all the questions. What can I even use on the platform, what backgrounds were there? That was my main source of inspirations.
[Interviewer]: Did you like the backgrounds? 
[Participant]: Yeah, they were cool! I had an idea for a house, but I kinda dropped it.
