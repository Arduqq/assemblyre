[Interviewer]: What was the most fun to you? 
[Participant]: The ==actual code-writing I found to be pretty lit==. Specifically, every time I put real code snippets in there, I thought about how implementable it all actually would be. ==Pseudocode is one thing, but what if it would take a million year to compute? Solving those micro-problems was intriguing. Especially when you have these super smooth solutions, that you most-likely just copied from someone else.== But you still can be happy about that. I have an input, and output, and thinking about everything taking place in between is very entertaining.
