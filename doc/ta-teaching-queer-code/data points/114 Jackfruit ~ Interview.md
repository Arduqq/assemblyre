[Interviewer]: Was there something that you found especially fun? 
[pause]
[Participant]: Yeah, the trees and the lake. [laughs] 
[Interviewer]: I am so happy you liked doing that, even though the editor isn't designed for stuff like that. It's so cool to me that you were able to overcome the limitations for your program. Do you feel like with all the things we've discussed, you would be able to have that discussion with other people who are not involved?
[Participant]: Yeah, with my mom [laughs] No, but generally with my family, where I know there isn't much expertise to be arguing against. That's where I feel most confident voicing my own opinions.
