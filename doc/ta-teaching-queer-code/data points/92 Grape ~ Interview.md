[Interviewer]: When we think of self-made syntax, societal problems play a big role. The course tried to convey the technical part of programming while discussing the social problems accordingly. Would you say it helped you in any way? Were you able to find personal conclusions on some of the topics that may have been new to you? 
[Participant]: Yes. One thing that blew my mind was a project that was an app about distributing masks where all users could contribute, and it worked out super efficiently. I thought it was fantastic. People aren't as stupid as one thinks, and when implemented correctly, it can be unbelievably efficient compared to software by the government. When you have attempts that are utter failures. As an example, imagine you would be able to self-proclaim that you have Covid in the Covid alert app. You wouldn't have to get a PCR test for that. This wouldn't have been a hassle to implement. And the other thing I see in science pretty often where marginalized groups are ignored in coding processes, like issues of sexism. Or like the alert app with the high white collar crime rate. That definitely stuck with me.
