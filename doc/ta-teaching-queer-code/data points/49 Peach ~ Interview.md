[Interviewer]: Back to my question. Did you have any topics that particularly stuck in your head? Any chapters that resonated with you. You mean data, obviously? Would you say that you would expand on that? If you saw articles on the subject, which ones would you click on?

[Participant]: I ==would watch the videos with the discussions==. These videos I found nice, the discussion videos. With articles, it depends on what news and what newspaper it is.

[Interviewer]: So you would prefer to stay on that more sociological, philosophical level rather the technical side. But still, do you find that even coming up with a syntax has helped you a little bit in dealing with the subject matter? So would you say that when you were programming, that you internalized the topics more?

[Participant]: The data now, or in general?

[Interviewer]: Generally in the course, yes. 

[Participant]: [Pause] ==As soon as it comes to loops, I think you get kind of stuck==. So of course I understand how a loop works, but I find that thinking it through [pause] At some point, you always lose the thread and think to yourself, oh, did I already include that? If I turn there now, what will happen? I find that totally difficult. ==But in itself I find it super interesting to think about how a computer thinks, because then you realize what you can actually do with a computer==. If that's the way it is, then it will take forever until artificial intelligence can really understand feelings. That's because it can really only turn one path and not take any shortcuts.
