[Interviewer]: Do you think you will be confronted with programming in the future? 
[Participant]: I actually was in my internship. I was part of the merch team, and since I already was working on something similar in your course, I accepted. Of course, the actual computer scientist did most of the heavy lifting, but I worked with a tool called Canva where you were able to design something. That's where I used some of that knowledge. Then I had some more practice with Gimp for a local festival, where I designed some festival ribbons.
