[Interviewer]: Do you believe that pseudoprograms like those here, would work as parts of an exhibit?
[Participant]: Yeah definitely. ==I think it had a lot of potential for something like that. I really loved one of the resources in this digital gallery where one could walk through there, edit the work of others and rate it.== I wasn't confident enough to do something by myself there, but walking through it was fascinating. There is always so much digital art in these exhibitions with projections, installations. Maybe not just two-dimensionally, but maybe even in a room where elements change and move around.
