[Interviewer]: You got a zine from me. What was your strategy? How did you go about it?

[Participant]: I worked through it chapter by chapter. I did that once, and then I went to the next chapter. I read the zine first and then went to the page, read through the material, then had like the first idea of what it was about. Okay, this is about loops, this is about data and then I looked at that and then I always tried to find what I had from the programming course. That was not so successful.

[Interviewer]: You looked at your own notes on this?

[Participant]: Yes ==I had taken notes== at that time and I thought that I could use those afterwards. But partly I thought [pause] I don't remember exactly.

[Interviewer]: On the internet you had also searched for infos?

[Participant]: Yeah. For the random stuff, ==I just googled, "How can I find out random things in Python?"== or something, and then that came up. Oh, that's so nice and short! 

[Interviewer]: That's really short. Most of the time other people have figured it out for you already.

[Participant]: Yeah I thought, nowhere does it say I can't google the internet. Then I partially pieced together from what I had from notes. I figured, okay, this was under the note loops, then it must fit together. I know something was there with Java, but I thought, I only know Python. No, I don't feel like Java right now. One programming language I know at least at 1% and I thought, I'll take that and I'll stick with it. ==That's what I was thinking about a little bit. And then at work I have to do a lot with Excel and I always try to use If-Then, so that at least you don't completely forget it. I will never program complex structures, but at least if-then.== 

[laughter]

[Interviewer]: To understand in general how it works is always very helpful. You can also go really deep into Excel.

[Participant]: I know! Somewhere I had found that you can draw a timeline and I had tried to find something about it, but there was not so much explanation. Then the idea was thrown away in the team. But then I thought, oh, there is so much more to Excel than meets the eye. 

[Interviewer]: There are also very complex loops there. You can go totally nuts there.

[Participant]: Once I had a little bit of time and then I programmed a whole evaluation somehow. I was a bit proud of that. ==There was a column with numbers and everything else ran back to it. Then it turned green, if it was positive it turned red for what we didn't have to pay attention to anymore. I think my bosses thought I spent too much time  on it, that I could have done other tasks. But I looked at it over the week and there were a lot of IF loops.==

[Interviewer]: That's great. I'm always glad to hear that you do get back into a similar mindset then even if it's just for a second.

[Participant]: Yeah, I think it's super handy because it saves you so much time. Also something like VLOOPKUP in Excel. 

[Interviewer]: That's also a loop.

[Participant]: Yeah, but one that I don't have to program anymore. But then it doesn't find the data because the name has to be entered in a different way. Then I have to go through it again and find the name from the table and put it into the next one.

[Interviewer]: Yes these manual processes are not lost. Oftentimes one must intervene then nevertheless.

[Participant]: Yes, but you still save quite a lot of time. I always write everything down in my workbook and everything.
