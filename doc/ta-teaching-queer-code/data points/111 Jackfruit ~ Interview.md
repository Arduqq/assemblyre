[Interviewer]: Yes! And I think it was so cool! If you'd like, we can talk about it for a second. I didn't read the book, but I looked at some excerpts, and the main point of the novel was the time nihilism. That man who doesn't see time like we do, but defines it by the changes that occur. What are your thoughts on this regard? 
[Participant]: Yeah, I don't know! I found the book very inspiring. It's crazy how, in general, I feel like every year goes by faster. Especially, the last weeks just moved past me. My mom and my grandma keep saying that it will move even faster now. But I can't even imagine that because it's already so fast. It's very interesting to me how the experiences you have such an impact on your feeling for time.
