[Interviewer]: Now with your current knowledge, with which words would you describe programming now? 
[Participant]: So how I feel right now?
[Interviewer]: Yeah! What's programming to you? How does it feel to program or to hear about it?
[Participant]: It's still very abstract to me because it barely has anything to do with what I do in my free time. It's not necessarily an interest of mine, either. That's why it's also still difficult for me. ==But I find it interesting that when it's portrayed in films and shows, or when you tell me about how it all works, it's still a bit of a mystery==. Generally, I do understand what's kind of behind it, but it's still portrayed in such an extreme light, like with things as the dark net, or cryptocurrency [laughs], it's feels like such a stereotype. But in the end ==it's more about using a website or dealing with programs.==
