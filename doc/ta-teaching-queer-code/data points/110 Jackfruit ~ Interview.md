[Interviewer]: You mention that you had problems to get really into it. Where were those initial hurdles?
[Participant]: At first, I didn't really know what my task was. At first, you had this brochure, then the code part, it was all clear. [pause] ==Then I read the questions and was like: Those questions are pretty big!== What exactly do you want from me? [laughs] 
[Interviewer]: Yeah, they were very open-ended, but I think you managed to overcome that pretty well. It all turned out great in the end. Did you have any particular strategy for your work? How was every program formed? 
[Participant]: At first, I read the text, oh I wish I had it here, oh well, then I made ==some notes on what stuck out to me.== It was generally inspired by what I was currently doing in life as well. I looked at the site, and its references. Especially with those shapes, ==I was pretty determined to create a whole landscape with them==. I believe I sat there for a whole hour planting those trees. [laughs] It was just so much fun at this moment. ==I am having so much fun!== And then I thought: What smart thing could I do with time?
