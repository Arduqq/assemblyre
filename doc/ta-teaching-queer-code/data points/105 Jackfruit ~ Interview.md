[Interviewer]: Awesome. So you participated, albeit a little while back, in a course on programming. Can you tell me how it generally felt attempting programming that is not as conventional as you may know?
[Participant]: Yeah, I can remember the beginning relatively well. When you came to us, and I just responded with a yes because I had some free time on my hands. But I immediately was ==afraid of what I got myself into here==! [laughs] I can't recall anything from my computer science course back in school. ==I thought I would get guided back into it step by step==, and then I had to [laughs] actually program something! [laughs] This was mostly my concern. But no, it wasn't like that at all, and I found that super nice to just dabble in it and get creative. ==Because of the little information boxes that you added, some things came back to me on what computer science were actually like==. It's like 7 years back, after all. Yeah. That was fascinating. It was fun to collect yourself some projects and just work on them. ==Unfortunately, the tool kinda messed them up.==  [laughs]
