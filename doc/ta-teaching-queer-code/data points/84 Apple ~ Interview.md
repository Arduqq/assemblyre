[Interviewer]: You have all your course submissions here. How does it feel looking at them? 
[Participant]: I think it's so interesting what I did there. 
[Interviewer]: I think it's apparent that you went through some progress where you at first were pretty tied to the resources that you were given, and then you kept hiding hyperlinks in there for me to find, which I really loved. And in the end, you confronted yourself with the more difficult sources where you took a stance on the racial injustice through AI. And I think you did a great job putting it all together with the help of the external tool. Is there any piece that you would consider your main one, one that you would choose as the face of your course progression?
[Participant]: [pause] Not directly. ==I like many of them. Maybe the love letters? But yeah, definitely, as you said==, the last one.
