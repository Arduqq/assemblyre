[Interviewer]: If you look at the entirety of your submissions, is there any piece that you would like to define as the face of your study - something you might feel most proud of.

[Participant]: Let me take a look [pause]. It's so difficult to choose because I love all of them. They all stand for one particular thought I had during the study and I love their general look. They just look so raw and silly and I am kind of proud of them [laughs]. I guess I would choose this one [points to submission 2], it's just this weird mix of memes that really stands for my whole approach to the course.
