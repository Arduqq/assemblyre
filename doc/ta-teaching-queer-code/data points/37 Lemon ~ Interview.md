[Interviewer]: So since you really enjoyed the more fun parts of the course, I would love to talk about the different games you seemed to have enjoyed.

[Participant]: Yeah I really liked Echo Beach and Kingdom game. I played it for way too long because I screwed up the first time around and I really wanted to make those townspeople happy [laughs].

[Interviewer]: [laughs] Yeah I remember us talking about these games a lot. What was it that captivated you with Echo Beach?

[Participant]: It was such a cool concept and I loved finding out more about those characters and listen to their music. ==It was so shocking when you realized that you would be able to endanger these people with just one click when I actually really liked them.== That way of putting you in the role of the person doing these terrible things was frightening.

[Interviewer]: Definitely. It was mentioned briefly in the course. This is a great example of Desktopization where people tasked with morally questionable jobs will be put in front of a display that will not inform of the social problems at hand. 

[Participant]: Yeah ==I think it's crazy to think about how one click can impact the lives of many and I am sure this reflects in many interfaces that we use==. That's why this game really stuck to my head.
