[Interviewer]: So you were a part of my study as a substitute for someone who couldn't make it, unfortunately. Foremost, I want to ask you how you liked the course.
[Participant]: It may be a little in the past, but I recall being involved with most of the resources on there, ==which were plentiful==. So I believe it couldn't have been very bad, or else I wouldn't even have stuck around. [laughs] ==Some of the things I found so cool, I bookmarked them!== 
[Interviewer]: Oh, cool, what exactly? 
[Participant]: For example, the ==digital artistry== thing. I was really impressed with that. 
[Interviewer]: What did you like the most about it? 
[Participant]: Making ==cool stuff with the simplest codes is nice as it is. What I found most impressive were the thoughts behind them and how genius the final artwork becomes==. It's just fundamentally beautiful.
