[Interviewer]: I can relate to that. The course itself was rather short for the amount of topics addressed. Let's say we had all the possibilities, what would be your wishes for the course form?
[Participant]: Maybe ==the little technical difficulties where things wouldn't work== as they should be, more opportunities for bug fixing in general. Aside from that, I felt like the ==texts in the zine were rather academic.== It would be great to have more of an introduction to ease you into these difficult topics, so people who are unfamiliar with any of it can get a new view on computer science. Maybe some super basic concepts if they have absolutely no connection to it.
