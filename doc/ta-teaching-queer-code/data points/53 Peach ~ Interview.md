[Interviewer]: But you had some pretty special ideas nonetheless! What were your strategies?

[Participant]: I ==had a look at your special material==. Okay, something like that, but simpler. [pause] [third delivery] Yes, that's the easiest. There is this Hello World. And then I thought, "Hello Artur. [laughter] [delivery four] And I couldn't think of a game, so I just designed ==a sales page for flowers==.

[Interviewer]: But I found the ideas quite specific. Here was flowers, here was friends, the tarot cards were inspired by the one game. The knitting instructions, cake baking, these are all hobbies that you internalize yourself, that are part of your identity. Would you say that it was easier for you when you said, I'm going to relate this to myself a little bit and take a theme that I've already been in touch with.

[Participant]: Yes, because you don't have to deal with a subject again. I always thought, ==what would I need?== I'm sure you can program a lot, but I don't care what others do. I had no idea for ages, ==but I just planned what I could give you for Christmas==. First I had the idea to knit a scarf by myself, which took way too much time and now only one person gets a scarf. [laughter] And then I just did that and played with the fact that you can insert pictures.
