[Interviewer]: Yeah maybe you remember the question: how would you, what words would you use to describe programming then like this. 

[pause.]

[Participant]: Complex for sure. And partly frustrating. So I can imagine you sitting there for ages in front of the code and then, ah, it probably doesn't work like that because I didn't do this and that. And to think like a computer, that you have to feed in every little bit [pause] I found that frustrating. I still find that frustrating. But also not very observing somehow. So it drags you in and I can totally understand that people kind of sit for six hours at a time to get their program to work.
